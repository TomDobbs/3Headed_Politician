That's just a "single issue" where @HillaryClinton and I differ.
In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.
In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree.
This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million.
Families LIVING IN POVERTY receiving cash benefits: 1996: 68% 2014: Only 23%
From 1996 to 2011, households living in EXTREME poverty increased 182% for African Americans; 132% for Hispanics; 109% for White Americans.
The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million.
It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.”
I called that bill “an assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.” I believed that then and I believe that now.
One of the biggest differences between the Clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-clinton-welfare-reform_us_5707cbf4e4b0c4e26a227a34

In a democratic society, politics should not be treated like a baseball game or a soap opera. We need discussion about serious issues.
Together, we can move to a foreign policy rooted in sound judgment that will move us away from perpetual warfare.
Americans need a president who will think about their future 10, 15, 20 years down the line — someone with judgment.
Unfortunately, what I predicted at the time about the destabilization of the region came true.
In 2003, I voted against the War in Iraq. It was a hard vote to cast when so many were calling for war.
That starts with defending veterans’ benefits from attempts to cut them in our Congress.
In the wake of that war, we must never forget the incredible sacrifices made by our veterans.
That’s money that could have been spent on rebuilding America’s schools, roads, bridges and water systems.
When the last benefits are calculated, that war will have cost the United States taxpayers several trillion dollars.
We invaded Iraq 13 years ago today. We must ask ourselves: are we more or less safe because of that war?

The right-wing in this country is waging a war against women and by working together, we will ensure that is a war they are going to lose.
Incredibly, today in many states, it is still legal to fire someone for being gay. That is unacceptable and must change.
Tonight’s speech was important. The president reminded us not to be afraid of change, but to wield it to improve the lives of all Americans.
We must prevent employers from discriminating against applicants based on criminal history by “banning the box.”
We must make high-quality childcare and Pre-K available to every American, regardless of income.
When it comes to the rights of women, we cannot go backwards. We have got to go forward. #Bernie2016
A humane immigration system must recognize that family is integral to a worker’s pursuit of happiness and economic productivity.

We need to ban prisons for profit, which result in an over-incentive to arrest, jail and detain in order to keep prison beds full.

What's fair is fair. All three of the Democratic candidates for president should be on the debate stage. Period.
If President Johnson had taken the same position as @HillaryClinton that a small payroll tax was unacceptable we wouldn't have Medicare.
If President Franklin Roosevelt had taken the same position that a small payroll tax is unacceptable we would not have Social Security.
Just like Social Security, paid family and medical leave is a program that workers would pay into. Just $1.61 a week for the average worker.

At the core of these policies should be compassion for unaccompanied minors and victims of domestic violence and criminal gang activity.

It is an outrage that not one major Wall Street executive has gone to jail for causing the near collapse of the economy.
We need a movement which tells Wall Street that when a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.
We need a movement that tells corporate America and the wealthy that you will start paying your fair share of taxes.
We need a movement which takes on the economic and political establishment, not one which is part of it.

We must implement a trade policy that demands that corporate America invests in this country rather than in countries all over the world.
If Congress cannot regulate Wall Street, there is just one alternative:  It is time to break these too big to fail banks up.
Climate change is real. It is caused by human activities. We must lead the world in combating the planetary crisis of global warming.
We should be investing in small businesses and worker-owned enterprises that want to create jobs in the United States of America.
Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires we should be expanding nutrition programs and other services for seniors.

What history shows is that when you give tax breaks to the rich and large corporations, the rich get richer, and the federal deficit soars.
We should not be providing corporate welfare to multi-national corporations through the Export-Import Bank.
This campaign is sending a message to the billionaire class:  “you can’t have it all.”

We must end the scandal in which millions of American employees work 50 or 60 hours a week and earn no overtime.
We need trade policies that represent the working families of this country not just the CEOs of large multinational corporations.
We need a banking system that is part of creating a productive economy, not a handful of huge banks that engage in reckless activities.
Millions of Americans are working for totally inadequate wages. The current federal minimum wage is a starvation wage and must be raised.
Despite exploding technology and increased worker productivity, median family income is almost $5,000 less than it was in 1999.
We’re building a movement of millions of Americans who are prepared to stand up and fight back. http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHgSjMDWIAAEneF.png
The minimum wage must become a living wage – which means raising it to $15 an hour over the next few years.

Since the Wall Street crash of 2008, more than 99% of all new income has gone to the top 1%. America needs a political revolution.

The skyrocketing level of income and wealth inequality is not only grotesque and immoral, it is economically unsustainable.
Despite an explosion in technology and a huge increase in productivity, the middle class continues to disappear.
This country faces many serious problems, and establishment politics will not successfully resolve them.
Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, while virtually all new income goes to the people who need it the least.
Wall Street cannot be an island  separate from the rest of the productive economy whose only goal is to make as much money as possible.

Let's invest in young people by making tuition free at all public colleges. Today, I will introduce a revolutionary bill to do just that.

We are the richest country in the world but that means nothing when almost all of the wealth and income ends up in the hands of the few.
Since 1999, the typical middle-class family has seen its income go down by almost $5,000 after adjusting for inflation.
RT @iantDC: Anti-#LGBT laws in countries like Brunei and Malaysia are one reason Congress should oppose the #TPP &amp; say #NoFastTrack, argues…
Despite exploding technology and increased productivity, millions of Americans today are working longer hours for lower wages.
We are experiencing a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class and for the billionaire class.
Why would we approve another trade deal like those that have failed so miserably? #NoTPP
Trade agreements should not just work for corporate America. They have got to benefit the working families of our country.
The United States must move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. Health care is a right not a privilege.
While a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I was one of those leading the fight against the deregulation of Wall Street.
We need to fundamentally rewrite our trade agreements so that our largest export does not become decent-paying American jobs.
It is absurd that in 1952, corporate income taxes provided 32 percent of federal revenue while, in 2014, they provided 11 percent.
We must listen to the scientists and lead the world in halting climate change so this planet is habitable for our kids and grandchildren.
Today, the top 0.1% owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, and one family owns more than the bottom 42%.
Over a period of a few years the national minimum wage should be $15 per hour.
Coming up at 5 p.m. ET: watch @BloombergTV for an interview on trade with #WADR.
Must read from @TheHill: Banks brace for Bernie Sanders http://bernie.to/th-banks
I am vigorously opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and will do everything that I can to defeat it.
Shamefully, the United States remains the only major industrialized country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.

Watch @FaceTheNation this morning on CBS for a discussion on our 2016 presidential campaign.

I want candidates to debate the real issues facing our country, not spend millions on ugly and negative 30-second ads.
Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, while virtually all new income goes to the people who need it the least.

What kind of nation are we when we give tax breaks to billionaires but we can't take care of the elderly and the children?
It's way past time that corporate America begin to create jobs in this country, not low-wage countries abroad.
A nation will not survive morally or economically when so few have so much, while so many have so little.
Nobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty.
They have the money, but we have the people. In the end, I believe the people can win. Join our campaign at http://BernieSanders.com/join.
I’m hoping to lead the fight against the TPP so that we do not continue to see shutdowns of factories in America.
Video from @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos. https://youtu.be/dbtnheO61x0

The Kochs are prepared to spend an unlimited sum of money to create an America shaped by their right-wing extremist views.
95% of all new income created in this country since the Great Recession went to the top 1%. #IncomeInequality
To equate the ability of billionaires to buy elections with ‘freedom of speech’ is totally absurd. #McCutcheon
The Koch brothers saw a $12 billion increase in their wealth last year and are now worth $80 billion. #IncomeInequality
Clearly the winners are the millionaires and billionaires in this country. #McCutcheon
Freedom of speech, in my view, does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government. #McCutcheon
The Walton family is now worth $148 billion - more wealth than the bottom 40%. #IncomeInequality

The #PaulRyan budget would kick up to 10 million Americans off Food Stamps. #hunger #poverty
Join Bernie this weekend in Brandon, Middletown Springs, Burlington and Morrisville. All details here: http://www.bernie.org/events/ #Vt
The #PaulRyan budget makes the Bush tax cuts permanent - that's over $1 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest 2% &amp; large corporations.
"I think what the fight here is about, is defeating the oligarchic form of government that Romney &amp; #PaulRyan want." http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-ed-show/48654455
#PaulRyan's budget would make huge cuts in #SocialSecurity, #Medicare, #Medicaid &amp; #education while giving more tax breaks to billionaires.
The #PaulRyan budget would slash college Pell grants by about 60% next year alone. #RyanBudget
#PaulRyan's budget would slash funding for roads, bridges, rail lines, transit systems, and airports by nearly 40% next year alone.

In 2009 Exxon Mobil not only paid nothing in federal income taxes, but actually received a $156 million rebate from the IRS that year.
Middle class families have seen their income go down by 8% from 2007-2010, and median family income is lower today than it was in 1999.
Ending the Bush tax breaks for the top 2% would reduce the deficit by about $1 trillion over the next decade.

Don't forget to follow @FriendsOfBernie on FB, as well: www.facebook.com/FriendsOfBernie #filibernie #sharedsacrifice
It's not only income, it's wealth. The top one percent own more wealth than the bottom ninety percent. Enough is enough. #sharedsacrifice
how can anybody be proud to say I'm a multimillionaire & I'm getting a huge tax break while 1/4 of kids are on food stamps? #sharedsacrifice
Effective tax rates for the top four hundred income earners in America was cut almost in half from 1992 to 2007. Time for #sharedsacrifice
The American people believe in the concept of #sharedsacrifice, not balancing the budget on the most vulnerable people in this country
The point that needs to be made is that when is enough, enough? #filibernie #sharedsacrifice
It is time for #SharedSacrifice
